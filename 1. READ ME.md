**Welcome to my CS portfolio!**

I am interested in python, HTML, and js

for python, I created...

1. **collatz conjecture (2020)** - Attempt to find pattern behind collatz conjecture via python.
2. **Equation solver (2021)** - Using Synthetic division to solve cubic equations.
3. **Grade Management programme (2022)** - (Not directly math nor science but applying my knowledge on it)
4. **(AI project 1) Backward-Propagation (2023-2024) && Neural Network - Poster.png** - Researched Neural Networks and made a poster about them. Ultimately working on my first AI project.

for js, I created...

1. **Lorenz attractor (2022)** - Making a simulator for Lorenz attractor using js
2. **Double pendulum (2022)** - Using the Lagrange method to find the physics behind the chaotic Double pendulum problem, using js to simulate it.

for HTML, I created...

since I was unable to add both css and js to HTML in Github, I only included HTML files and website links.

1. **Math Quiz (2021)** - I made my math quiz, inspired by AMC && UKMT && KMO. I made it to challenge my friends. This is my link ( https://4ce5be56-0dc3-47f3-88a7-e4664b39cae0-00-7aekbx6azrwr.global.replit.dev/ )
2. **AI texting (2023)** - I made AI texting website, using the API key from chat GPT. This is my link (https://f78a0a2f-c3e5-498d-b906-eae8d7ca63ad-00-fvtb9ziktuo5.global.replit.dev/)

**Thank you**
